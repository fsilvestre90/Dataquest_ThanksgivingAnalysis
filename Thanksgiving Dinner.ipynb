    "# Analyzing Thanksgiving Dinner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspiration\n",
    "Thanksgiving is a great tradition where people come together around food. I haven't celebrated with my family since I moved out west, so I was curious how other people celebrate this holiday. My parents immigrated from Portugal, so I have a very different experience than an American family. \n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data\n",
    "Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the data below."
